# Customer-Segmentation

Grouping customers into sections based on their common characteristics is called Customer Segmentation. These clusters allow the companies to target the customers with the correct marketing message and tailor their offers for a specific group. This not only helps them boost their sales, but also helps them build customer relations and understand them in a better way. In this project, our aim will be to perform customer segmentation on Online Retail Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail#) to understand the customers. Given this dataset, our task is to: a) Load the dataset and perform a descriptive analysis on it (Total number of entries, the column types, unique/non-null entries for each attribute, unique stock items, visualizing various attributes using bar charts/piecharts and so on). b) Perform data cleaning. Specifically, given the dataset, handle the entries that either have missing information or have attribute values that are not feasible such as negative quantity. c) Perform data pre-processing for the required attribute fields. d) Since this database has no additional attribute information for the customer, we will use RFM model (refer: https://clevertap.com/blog/rfmanalysis/) for segmentation. Modify the database to include RFM model attributes. e) Now once you have your database ready, perform data clustering on this dataset by assuming a fixed number of clusters. f) Find the optimal number of clusters that the customers can be divided into

Procedure
a) Load and Perform Descriptive Analysis:

Load the dataset from the provided URL using appropriate data loading libraries such as Pandas in Python. Check the total number of entries (rows) and the number of attributes (columns). Examine the data types of each attribute (column). Check for missing information (null values) in each attribute. Examine unique values or non-null entries for each attribute. Visualize various attributes using bar charts, pie charts, histograms, or other suitable plots to gain insights into the data. b) Data Cleaning:

Handle entries with missing information (null values) by either removing rows with missing values or imputing them. Handle entries with attribute values that are not feasible, such as negative quantity or price. You can choose to remove or correct such entries. c) Data Pre-processing:

Pre-process the required attribute fields. This may include standardizing, normalizing, or encoding categorical variables if necessary. d) RFM Model Attribute Creation:

Implement the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model for customer segmentation. Create three new attributes: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value for each customer based on their purchase history. Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase. Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases. Monetary Value: How much money a customer has spent. e) Data Clustering:

Use a clustering algorithm, such as K-Means or hierarchical clustering, to perform customer segmentation based on the RFM attributes. You can choose a fixed number of clusters as a starting point. f) Finding Optimal Number of Clusters:

To find the optimal number of clusters, you can employ techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score. The Elbow Method involves plotting the sum of squared distances (inertia) for different numbers of clusters and selecting the "elbow point" where the inertia starts to level off. Silhouette Score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Higher Silhouette Scores indicate better-defined clusters. In summary, this project involves loading, cleaning, and pre-processing the dataset, creating RFM attributes, performing data clustering, and finding the optimal number of clusters for customer segmentation. Be sure to document your findings and share insights from the analysis, as this will help companies better target and understand their customers.
